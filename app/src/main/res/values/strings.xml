    <string name="about">BPR is a new power metric for the FIRST Robotics Competition.
        BPR shows a team\'s average contribution to a specific scoring target. BPR allows you to look at data beyond a team\'s estimated contribution to their alliance\'s score.
        \n\nA team\'s BPR in a scoring area shows the team\'s average contribution to that specific scoring area. For example, a Steamworks robot that scored a large number of points spending the entirety of every match dumping fuel into the low goal would have a high low-goal BPR but a low climbing and rotor BPR.
        \n\nThe BPR app is open-source at https://github.com/dc74089/jen-scout. The app is a thin Android GUI for an open-source Java library used to find BPR, which can be found at https://github.com/dc74089/frc-power-calc.
